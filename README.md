## Few Flavors of template pattern
#### Simple Template Pattern -> package:com.patterns.template.simple 
#### Template Pattern with polymorphism with eliminating abstract classes and using generics -> package: com.patterns.template.generics
#### Template Pattern using composition and applying to enterprise patterns -> package: com.patterns.template.composition

## Additional Changes
#### Logging changes for log4j2 using lambda, with performance enhancements where string is computed only if level is on avoiding if (logger.isLevelEnabled()) checks across the codebase
#### JSR validation for the bean
#### Tests for the composition using Lambda as well.
